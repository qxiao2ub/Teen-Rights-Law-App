# UI Migration Notes

The provided UI archive was a React/TanStack/Lovable project using a Legal Counsel design system with soft teal as the primary color, warm coral as the action accent, amber highlights, rounded cards, and the Nova/Voicebox/Chatbox/Minigames/Progress Gavel product model.

For Streamlit Community Cloud reliability, the production runtime does **not** require Node, Vite, React, TanStack, or a second web server. Instead, the supplied visual language and interaction model were reimplemented natively in `streamlit_app.py` using Streamlit widgets plus scoped CSS.

Migrated concepts include:

- Legal Counsel header/product identity
- Nova AI guide identity
- dotted hero surface
- teal/coral/amber design tokens
- rounded feature cards
- mobile phone / Voicebox mockup
- conversation bubbles
- Voicebox workflow
- Chatbox workflow
- Minigame cards and situation questions
- Progress Gavel concept
- privacy/safety callouts
- responsive multi-column layout

The Python legal-learning engine, safety guard, moderation, learner clustering demonstration, and bounded activity recommender remain in `src/legal_engine.py`.
